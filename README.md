# FilmsList App

## Description

The FilmsList app is a simple React application developed as part of the True Coders Full Stack Boot Camp. It provides users with a list of films from Studio Ghibli's API, offering details such as director, release year, and Rotten Tomatoes scores. This project serves as a learning tool for integrating React with external APIs.

## Features

- **Film Browsing**: Users can view a list of Studio Ghibli films.
- **Detailed Information**: Click on any film to view more details like the director, release year, and Rotten Tomatoes score.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a good viewing experience on devices of various sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **Studio Ghibli API**: For fetching films data.

## Future Scope

- **Node.js/Express.js**: To set up a back-end server for handling more complex API interactions.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data and favorites.
- **Integration with Other Film APIs**: To expand the database to include films from other studios and provide more comprehensive data.
